\section*{Preface}

DialDam brings the SEMDIAL Workshop on the Semantics and Pragmatics of
Dialogue back to Amsterdam, where the second meeting ---
  Amstelogue --- took place in 1999. The return to Amsterdam has brought about the
opportunity to collocate SEMDIAL with the Amsterdam Colloquium, a
premier forum for formal work on semantics and pragmatics. 
We are excited about this opportunity and we hope that it will
encourage interaction between the two communities, which seem to have
drifted somewhat apart over the last few years. To stimulate contact, the last session
of DialDam will be offered as a special session on dialogue within the Amsterdam
Colloquium.

\hspace*{20pt}
While in the  initial years of the SEMDIAL series the
focus was on what could be called classic semantics and
pragmatics, over the last decade and a half the scope of SEMDIAL has broadened
significantly. It now covers a wide range of topics concerned with
 aspects of dialogue, ranging from the acquisition of
conversational competence by children, experimental semantics and
psycholinguistic studies, to work on the design of
artificial conversational agents, human interaction with robots, and
the computational modelling of disfluencies, gesture, gaze, and
turn taking. The collection of papers presented in this volume offer a
good overview of the diversity of angles from which the study of
dialogue can be tackled. 

\hspace*{20pt}
We received a total of 40 full paper submissions,  17 of which were
accepted after a peer-reviewing process during which each submission
was reviewed by three experts. We are extremely 
grateful to the Programme Committee members for their very detailed
and helpful reviews. Three papers amongst the accepted
submissions were selected for presentation in the special session with
the Amsterdam Colloquium, in collaboration with Maria Aloni
(representing the Amsterdam Colloquium) and on the
basis of affinity with the scope of the colloquium. 
In response to a later call, we received a total of 30 abstract
submissions describing ongoing projects or system demonstrations, of
which 26 were accepted for poster presentation. Abstract submissions were not refereed, but evaluated for
relevance to the SEMDIAL topics of interest only by ourselves in our role as chairs. All accepted full
papers and poster abstracts are included in this volume.

\hspace*{20pt}
In addition, the DialDam programme features three keynote
presentations by Danielle Matthews,  Marc Swerts, and Matthew Stone (who will give a
plenary talk for the audiences of both SEMDIAL and the Amsterdam
Colloquium). We are honoured to have them at the
workshop and are looking forward to their talks. Abstracts of their
contributions are also included in this volume.

\hspace*{20pt}
DialDam has received generous financial support from the Netherlands
Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), the Benelux Association for
Artificial Intelligence (BNVKI), the Gemeente Amsterdam, and the Institute for
Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC), which hosts the event. We are
very grateful for their sponsorship, as well as for the endorsement by the
ACL Special Interest Groups SIGdial and SIGSEM; and last but not least
for the tireless work of In\'es Crespo who helped with all aspects of
the local organisation, as well as of Peter van Ormondt from the ILLC office.
