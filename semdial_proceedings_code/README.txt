HOW TO COMPILE SEMDIAL PROCEEDINGS
==================================

1) Edit the file `semdial_proceedings_template.tex’

You can create the proceedings “manually” by adding each paper with the command
	\goodpaper{path_PDF_file}{Title}{Authors} 
This creates an entry in the ToC and adds the PDF of each paper to the proceedings. See the file sample_SemDial2013DialDam_proceedings.tex

Alternatively, you can add the papers automatically by using some output from Easychair and the Python scripts provided in this directory. See the next steps. If you opt for this (recommended), you still need to first edit the main file `semdial_proceedings_template.tex’.


2) Generate some input files with the Proceedings facility of Easychair as follows:

- Go to the Proceedings tab and log in as Proceedings Manager in Easychair.
- Go to section “Proceedings” > “Workflow”
- Click on “create content”.

- Click on “Order of papers”. Select the predefined order “First invited papers, then papers alphabetically ordered by the last names of their authors”. Click on “Store this predefined order”. Copy the output and paste it into a text file called `order.txt’ (you will need to edit this file later - see below). 

- Go back to “Contents”.
- Generate the table of contents in Latex format.
 
- Click on “Generate volume” and then on “Download proceedings”. This will download a directory “proceedings”. From this you need the directory “papers” with all PDFs and the file `toc.tex’ (see the sample file `sample_toc.tex’).


3) Edit the material generated by Easychair:

- Add one PDF file for each of the invited talks to the directory `papers/‘. Name these files `invited_paper_(-nn).pdf’ (-nn is a negative number — see the comments in the file `generate.py’).

- Edit the `order.txt’ file you have created: add the invited talk files and separate them from full papers and abstracts. See the sample file `sample_order.txt’ and the comments in `generate.py’ for how to do this.


4) Make sure you have all these files in the same directory:  
- order.txt
- toc.tex
- papers/
- semdial_proceedings_template.tex
- extract_meta.py
- generate.py
- make.sh


5) Run `make.sh’ to generate the proceedings. This will first run `extract_meta.py’ to generate `index.txt’ from `order.txt’, and then run `generate.py’ to generate the proceedings as `SemDial_proceedings.tex’ and `SemDial_proceedings.pdf’ (with pdflatex).
